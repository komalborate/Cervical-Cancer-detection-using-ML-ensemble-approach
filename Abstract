# Cervical-Cancer-detection-using-ML-ensemble-approach
Cervical cancer is one of the topics talked about because of the current death rate due to cervical cancer. It is a most dominating and deadly disease spreading across the world. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancers in women and in the world, it ranks eighth across the world’s deadliest diseases. In most of the regions in the world, if it goes undetected people die without the proper treatment. To detect this type of cancer, few tests are available such as the Pap smear test, Colposcopy, HPV testing. Pap smear is the most accepted one and available worldwide. But these tests are time-consuming, and  one must do these tests on a regular basis which makes a tiring process. On the other hand, these tests are expensive and can not be found in certain small-scale areas in few countries. There is another technology limitation which holds back patients from doing the tests. If the cancer is not detectable at an early stage, it is difficult to cure at later stages as it keeps on spreading to other cervix areas rapidly if any precaution is not taken.  
In this research, five different machine learning algorithms have been used and the ensemble of them is used to detect the specificity and sensitivity of the model. In the medical field, results often considered valid based on their sensitivity and specificity.  
The study uses a patient’s medical history records for analysis and in this study, the Pap test has not been used for image classification as we apply the dataset to the model created on different tools. An ensemble approach is applied as a support to detect cervical cancer at early stages to treat it before it spreads to other areas. 
In this paper, five machine learning algorithms have been applied to create an ensemble for enhanced accuracy using three tools. This study is about research on ensemble techniques which will help in detecting cancer at early stages.
